#Let's start with something basic : text manipulation
txt='Hello World'
print(txt)
# and then let's play 
# write the text by step of 2 characters starting from the 2nd (index 0)
print(txt[0::2])
# write the text by step of 2 characters starting from the 2nd (index 1)
print(txt[1::2])
# write reversed text
print(txt[::-1])
# write in reverse by steps of 2
print(txt[::-2])
